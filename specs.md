### 2. Art Style  
- Visual Direction: 2D isometric environments. 
  - Key Features:
  The game's art style is a homage to vintage journalism, employing a grayscale color scheme with sepia highlights to reflect the aged look of old newspapers. Typography is key, with serif fonts and simulated letterpress printing creating an authentic feel. The layout mirrors newspaper design, with columnar text and headline banners. Visuals include grainy, black-and-white imagery and poster art inspired by early 20th-century advertisements.  
- Technical Art:  
  - Isometric grid alignment for object placement (64x32px tiles for consistency).  
  - Depth sorting for characters/environment interactions.
